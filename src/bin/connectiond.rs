//! Main executable for connectiond: lightning peer network connection
//! microservice.
//!
//! Program operations
//! ==================
//!
//! Bootstrapping
//! -------------
//!
//! Since this daemon must operate external P2P TCP socket, and TCP socket can
//! be either connected to the remote or accept remote connections; and we need
//! a daemon per connection, while the incoming TCP socket can't be transferred
//! between processes using IPC, the only option here is to have two special
//! cases of the daemon.
//!
//! The first one will open TCP socket in listening mode and wait for incoming
//! connections, forking on each one of them, passing the accepted TCP socket to
//! the child and continuing on listening to the new connections. (In
//! multi-thread mode, differentiated with `--threaded` argument, instead of
//! forking damon will launch a new thread).
//!
//! The second one will be launched by some control process and then commanded
//! (through command API) to connect to a specific remote TCP socket.
//!
//! These two cases are differentiated by a presence command-line option
//! `--listen` followed by a listening address to bind (IPv4, IPv6, Tor and TCP
//! port number) or `--connect` option followed by a remote address in the same
//! format.
//!
//! Runtime
//! -------
//!
//! The overall program logic thus is the following:
//!
//! In the process starting from `main()`:
//! - Parse cli arguments into a config. There is no config file, since the
//!   daemon can be started only from another control process (`lnpd`) or by
//!   forking itself.
//! - If `--listen` argument is present, start a listening version as described
//!   above and open TCP port in listening mode; wait for incoming connections
//! - If `--connect` argument is present, connect to the remote TCP peer
//!
//! In forked/spawned version:
//! - Acquire connected TCP socket from the parent
//!
//! From here, all actions must be taken by either forked version or by a daemon
//! launched from the control process:
//! - Split TCP socket and related transcoders into reading and writing parts
//! - Create bridge ZMQ PAIR socket
//! - Put both TCP socket reading ZMQ bridge write PAIR parts into a thread
//!   ("bridge")
//! - Open control interface socket
//! - Create run loop in the main thread for polling three ZMQ sockets:
//!   * control interface
//!   * LN P2P messages from intranet
//!   * bridge socket
//!
//! Node key
//! --------
//!
//! Node key, used for node identification and in generation of the encryption
//! keys, is read from the file specified in `--key-file` parameter, or (if the
//! parameter is absent) from `LNP_NODE_KEY_FILE` environment variable.
